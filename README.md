# TestCase Management System

A small academic project for testcase management and reports connected with an automation node

## How it works:
- CD inside "Python_Automation_Node"
- Run command "python node_cli.py -l"
- Login with the user creds
- Now go to server and login with an user cred
- Create a Testcase and add actions inside it
- Run the testcase and the Node will execute auto test and create a report
- See the report on the server page
